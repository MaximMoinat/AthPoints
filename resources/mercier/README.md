In contrast to the other formulas, the points are rounded up.

## Formulas
||||
|--|--|--|
|Timed Events|`(a * (d / x) - b + c) / y`|
|Distance Events|`(a * √x - b + c) / y`  |
|Points Events|`(a * x - b + c) / y`     |

### Simplified form
The above formulas use the original constants. However, we can simplify these to get a better understanding of the relationship.

||||
|--|--|--|
|Timed Events|`A * d/x + B`|
|Distance Events|`A * √x + B`|
|Points Events|`A * x + B`|

where:\
`A = a/y`\
`B = (c-b)/y`
